# claylike festival

by Jason Zeng

# project overview

Claylike festival supports original Chinese artists to express creativity and uniqueness through their artwork and raise awareness for authentic and original content of works derived or drawn inspirations from Chinese culture. Our mission is to help Chinese youth to express their talents freely. We believe that their creative minds are clay like, so we want to give them the access to shape it how they want.

However, this event has another focus which the intervention of stopping mainstream assimiliation. Mainstream culture has changed lots of traditions that was brought here by Chinese immigrants, representing their identity and roots. They first came here during the Gold Rush era and the adaptation to a new western society has inevitably washed out their culture. It's important to preserve and revive those valuable symbol of Chinese culture. Moreover, encourage the youths to carry on and pass to our next generations. To many of us, itâ€™s a sense of belonging and a form of bridge that connects and unites all of us. 


## audience

Nowadays, many Chinese decendants rather feel disconnected from their roots. 

That being said, the main audience for this event would be Chinese youth that may or may not be familiar to Chinese traditions and heritage and being intersted in acquiring those missing puzzles reflected by the lens of Chinese art work techniques throughout thousands of years. 

Secondary audience would be anyone who has interest in learning Chinese history or art history.
